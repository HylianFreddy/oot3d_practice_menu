These templates are modified versions of the game's vanilla exheader, with the edits listed below. When building the patch, one additional change is applied to the size of the data/bss sections (see patch.py).

Edits to USA exheader template:
- text section size, at 0x18, changed from 0x003C99A8 to 0x003CA000
- service access controls in first ACI, starts at 0x250, appended "ir:rst" at 0x328
- service access controls in second ACI, starts at 0x650, appended "ir:rst" at 0x728
- kernel capabilities descriptors, starts at 0x370, inserted "\x00\x00\x01\xF4" at 0x37C, shifting data until 0x39F

EUR and JPN versions work with the USA exheader, even though the original file stores the title id in a couple of places, and can have some other differences like SDApplication flag and AccessDesc signature.


Edits to KOR exheader template:
- text section size, at 0x18, changed from 0x3CF2C4 to 0x3D0000

- service access controls in second ACI, starts at 0x650, appended "ir:rst" at 0x730
